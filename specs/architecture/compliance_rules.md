# Compliance Rules

## Shipped Product Rules

1. **Native only** — shipped product must be a native compiled binary
2. **No Python** — shipped product must not depend on Python runtime
3. **No YAML** — shipped product must not include a YAML parser
4. **JSON-only v0.1** — all configuration files are JSON
5. **Host-agnostic core** — core healing logic has no platform UI dependencies
6. **Interface-based Forsetti** — Forsetti integration via interfaces, not direct coupling

## Repository Automation (Exempt)

Python and YAML are permitted in:
- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
- CI scripts (`ci/`)
- Repository automation scripts (`.github/scripts/`)

These are not part of the shipped product.
